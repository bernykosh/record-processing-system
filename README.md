A Record Processing System in both ASP and PHP

Hi ! This is a simple Record Processing System implemented in both ASP and PHP separately.<br>

- This use of Functions, Control Structures, Input Validation, Conditions, and basic numerical calculations will form the core of each 
ASP/PHP script.

- Both the developed ASP and PHP page will read in the data from the attached forms, <br>
 validate the data (looking for physical and logical errors), <br>
 then process the data and output a summary. <br>
 
- This script processes a list of units in order to help students figure out how much of their course they have completed <br>
and how far they have to go. <br>

- The following is the output: <br>
-- Total Passed Credit Points <br>
-- The Credit Points Required <br>
-- Students name, student id, student's course average (indicated as a mark and a grade) and Course type <br>
-- If a student has completed more than 66% (two thirds) of their course, and they
    have a single unit with a score between 40-45, they get a ‘Supp assessment’ in the Grade coloumn, whereas if the score is 46-49, 
    they get a ‘Conceded Pass’. <br>
-- Indicate how many units have been attempted and how many have been successfully completed <br>
-- Indicate in the output any errors, such as blank fields or any other user input errors <br>
-- If the student has obtained or gone over their required Credit Points for their course a Course Completed indicator appears on screen <br>

- I implemented ASP on Visual Studio Code and PHP on JetBeans PhpStorm Application.
